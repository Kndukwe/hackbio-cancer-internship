_Drug Repurposing for Cancer._

_Drug discovery is a time-consuming endeavor. Form the discovery of the lead compound to the preclinical and clinical phases of the development could be a long process with significant investment of time and money. A systematic review study on the cost to research and development of new drugs, put had the cost ranging from $161 million to $4.54 billion depending on the therapeutic area (Schlander et al 2021). The clinical stages (Phase I, II, and III trials and marketing authorization) accounting for more that half the cost of new drug development (Simoens and Huys,2021). The average timing for the stage of drug development ranges between 10 – 15 years. And most of the time is spent in the early stages. From the time spent for the drug to go from the lab to the initial pre-clinical testing before it gets to the clinical stages (Mohs and Greig, 2017). _

_Drug repurposing or repositioning is the way to significantly reduce the cost of drug development and get the patients the drug they urgently need for their condition in less time than the traditional process._

_Drug repurposing is a way of using an already approved drug for a new treatment for which it was not originally developed to treat (Kulkarni et al 2023). This process gained significant attention during the COVID-19 pandemics there was no drug available or approved for the pandemic. Drug repurposing can be achieved through serendipity or through systematic approaches. It could be achieved by using data from primary and clinical research and anecdotal reports to understand the off-label uses. Also combining publicly available information on the drug-disease pathway (disease omics data or genetic and proteomics data on disease) and artificial intelligence can help identify the drug for a different disease (Kulkarni et al 2023). _

_Cancer is a significant challenge to global health and drug repurposing can help identify new anti-tumor applications for existing, clinically approved drugs. Drug repurposing offers several key benefits in cancer treatment, as these drugs are generally cheaper by reducing the cost associated with development, already proven to be safe, and can greatly accelerate the drug development process because their safety profiles are already established (Xia at al 2024). There are plethora of preclinical, observational, and clinical studies and FDA-approved drugs repurposed for cancer therapy (Hijazi et al, 2023). _

_Computational repurposing is an emerging and reliable strategy in drug discovery, with a growing body of work showcasing its applications and experimental validations. A significant aspect of this approach is the use of machine learning. Advancements in machine learning, coupled with the accessibility of publicly available data, will significantly enhance drug repurposing efforts (Urbina et al 2021).  But improvements in the computational models have to be coupled with accurately curated data set from previous omics studies to get meaningful information that will help build efficient models that can help reposition _
